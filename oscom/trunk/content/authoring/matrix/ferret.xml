  <description>Ferret CMS provides a simple yet powerful Content Management System
for creating small- to medium-sized websites.  The default configuration
is designed to meet many of the specific needs of most corporate
presentation sites.  It is easy to use for the non-technical user and
simple to install and administer, while still being flexible and
powerful for the developer.
Ferret CMS is based on Zope (http://www.zope.org/).  It's main advantage
over other content management systems available for Zope and in general
is that the administration backend is simple and easy to use, and
configuration is very simple.  A fully functional site (sans content)
can be set up within five minutes and the visual configuration can be
done by any developer with basic-to-intermediate knowledge of Zope
programming.
